# Jargon-less functional programming (in TypeScript)

This repo is a demo code for my (future as of `21 Jul 2022`) blog about functional programming.

The idea is to show the value and core concepts of functional programming to mere mortals,
avoiding the fancy jargon surrounding the topic.

Think real problem, solved in a true functional way, without mentioning the monads, functors and monad transformers
but actually using those concepts. Dang, not just using but inventing them from scratch!
